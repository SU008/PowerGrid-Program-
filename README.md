# PowerGrid-Program-
A Class is used to represent a power grid, Grid points are represented as a matrix with the data member.


About the program:

(a)  Design a class to represent a power grid. Grid points should be represented as a matrix with the data member:
 
int PowerGrid[GridRows][GridCols]

(b) Develop all relevant default and overloaded constructors. Create methods to switch on or off any grid point, to interrogate the grid to determine if any points are off and to locate their positions in the grid. 

(c) Derive a super grid class that contains a number of grid objects. Create methods to switch on or off all points in any grid object or any individual grid point in a grid object. Create methods to interrogate all or any grid objects to determine if any entire grid object or individual grid points are off and to locate their positions in the grids. 

(d) Include a main program that creates objects of the types above and exercises all of the methods.		
			     		         
(e) Include iostream overloading to allow keyboard input and screen output of grid and supergrid data. Include iostream operations in the main program to illustrate the overloading.

(f) Debug, Verify and Validate the code
